# Mathematical-Papers
This repository contains some programs I created for my Mathematical courses ( MATH450 - Numerical Analysis and MATH497 - Number Theory)

Overview on the courses: Numerical Analysis courses approaches numerical solutions to systems of equations and differential equations, finite differences, interpolation formulas, numerical calculus, and approximating functions.

Number Theory is a pure Mathematics branch that handles the foundation and properties of numbers and integers.

With higher level mathematical courses, the concepts were a bit hard to grasp, hence I decided to write programs for topics, concepts and methods I came across. This enabled me to understand the concepts better and gave me an opportunity to check the computation.
